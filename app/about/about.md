Hey there, my name is Mihir. I am a software engineer with 4 years of experience building scalable, high-performance backend systems. I am passionate about designing efficient and fault-tolerant system architectures. I am skilled in integrating LLMs into production environments, with hands-on experience in prompt engineering and GenAI implementation. I enjoy tackling complex problems, drive high-impact solutions, and lead projects that enhance system reliability, performance, and scalability. I love exploring tech and [hacking](https://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) together cool projects. I love Emacs!

### Work Experience
At [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/), Iâ€™ve led initiatives that include:
- Designing a high-throughput architecture for LLM integration, supporting 1.5K RPS
- Engineering a Kafka-based asynchronous task queue that cut load average by 30%
- Building multilingual AI-powered translation systems that increased user engagement by 20%
- Mentoring new engineers, driving clean code practices and team-wide efficiency

### Projects and Open Source Contribution
My open-source work in graph embeddings (clj-deepwalk) has been featured in Clojure Deref, and I continue to experiment with tools at the intersection of AI and systems.

#### [Clj-deepwalk](https://github.com/mihirrd/clj-deepwalk)
- Graph Embedding library written in Clojure.
- Implements [Deepwalk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652) for learning graph node embeddings
- Enables vector-based reasoning and similarity search over graph structures
- Lightweight, modular, and easy to extend for research or production use


#### [Ollama MCP Client](https://github.com/mihirrd/ollama-mcp-client)
- Seamless integration between Ollama language models and MCP servers
- Native support for Git operations via MCP Git server
- Extensible architecture for managing multiple MCP servers
- Rich, interactive Terminal UI for a smooth user experience

#### [AIde](https://github.com/mihirrd/aide)
- Generates coding challenges using OpenAI
- Evaluates user-submitted solutions automatically
- Provides detailed, actionable feedback
- Helps developers sharpen coding skills through interactive practice

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™ll be joining Purdue, West Lafayette in Fall 2025 for MS in Software Engineering, with a focus on distributed systems and backend architecture.

Letâ€™s connect if you're hiring for backend or platform roles â€” or if you're working on systems where performance, reliability, and scalability are top priorities.

On a sidenote, I am also a Sitar Player and a student of Indian Classical Music. I have been teaching sitar since 2024 both - online and in person.
