title: 'About me'
---

My name is Mihir. I am a software engineer with 4 years of experience building scalable, high-performance backend systems. I am currently pursuing my masters in Software Engineering at Purdue University. I am passionate about designing efficient and fault-tolerant system architectures. I am skilled in integrating LLMs into production environments, with hands-on experience in prompt engineering and GenAI implementation. I enjoy tackling complex problems, drive high-impact solutions, and lead projects that enhance system reliability, performance, and scalability. I love exploring tech and [hacking](https://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) together cool projects. I love Emacs!

## Work Experience
At [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/), Iâ€™ve led initiatives that include:
- Designing and implementing a high-throughput system with Clojure Workers for third-party LLM integration within a production chatbot service, supporting 1.5K RPS.
- Engineering a Kafka-based asynchronous task queue that cut load average by 30%
- Architecting and implementing a secure, extensible Plugin Framework, with JWT-based authentication and YugabyteDB as the distributed SQL database, enabling dynamic plugin registration and multi-tenant scalability.
- Mentoring new engineers, driving clean code practices and team-wide efficiency.

## Projects and Open Source Contribution


### [Pensieve](https://github.com/mihirrd/pensieve)
Pensieve is a durable, in-memory keyâ€“value store written in Rust. It uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for eviction and exposes a HTTP REST API via the Axum. The name Pensieve comes from one of the most fascinating magical objects in the [Wizarding World](https://www.harrypotter.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pensieve).

- HTTP REST APIs
- Write-ahead logs for durability
- Thread-safe via <code>Arc<Mutex<...>></code>
- Multi-node cluster support with Docker
- Inter-node heartbeat system for failure detection


### [Clj-deepwalk](https://github.com/mihirrd/clj-deepwalk)
clj-deepwalk is a Graph Embedding library written in Clojure. It provides handy APIs to generate vector embeddings for complex Graphs.
clj-deepwalk has also been recognized in [Clojure Deref](https://clojure.org/news/2025/01/17/deref)

- Implements [Deepwalk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652) for learning graph node embeddings
- Enables vector-based reasoning and similarity search over graph structures
- Lightweight, modular, and easy to extend for research or production use


### [Ollama MCP Client](https://github.com/mihirrd/ollama-mcp-client)
Highly modular and extensible client for MCP tools in Ollama models

- Seamless integration between MCP servers and Ollama language models
- Native support for Git operations via MCP Git server, with support for extending multiple MCP servers
- Rich, interactive Terminal UI for a smooth user experience

### [AIde](https://github.com/mihirrd/aide)
Aide acts like an on-demand tutor for those preparing for coding interviews.

- Generates coding challenges using OpenAI
- Evaluates user-submitted solutions automatically
- Provides detailed, actionable feedback
- Helps developers sharpen coding skills through interactive practice
