It has been around six years since I started learning to play the sitar. It’s not too long considering people spend 20–30 years in the process. But now when I look back, I see that the part where I was learning “how to play the sitar” was just the initial 2 to 3 years. After that, it has been more about learning how to create quality music.

Teaching someone how to create good music is exponentially more difficult than teaching them how to play the instrument. Playing the instrument is a craft while weaving melodies is an art. There’s simply no defined framework following which one reaches the finish line. There’s no finish line at all!

The only possible way to develop this artistry is through meticulous observation. By observing the Guru, the masters, by going further deep into the question of what makes good music good, one cultivates a deeper understanding of its multifaceted aspects. The idea of “good music” becomes more and more transparent as you actively listen to more and more maestros.

In my opinion, this is the most effective path to achieve mastery in any pursuit. As a programmer, I find it oddly disturbing how numerous online tutorials claim to help you “master node.js in 6 hours”, obscuring the entire complexity of the subject. While coding tutorials teach you the technique, observing high-quality code will impart wisdom.

Observe the masters!
