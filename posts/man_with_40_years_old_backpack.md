On a Wednesday evening, as I stood in the parking lot after our weekly office football game, my eyes landed on my colleague’s backpack — a weathered relic that looked like it had stories to tell.

“Hey, your backpack’s open,” I called out, noticing a broken zipper.

He shrugged. “Yeah, it needs repairing again.”

I was about to suggest he replace it when he added, “It’s 40 years old, you know. I’m never getting rid of it.”

This from a man who has spent two decades in the US, climbing the corporate ladder from Software Engineer at Amazon to Engineering manager at Meta, to the Head of Engineering at the company I work for. Someone who could easily afford the most luxurious bags money could buy. Yet here he was, cherishing this worn-out piece of fabric like a treasure.

He said, “It belonged to my cousin. She gave it to me when I first went to college. I was a poor kid in America at that time, and people did whatever they could to help me save money. I have been using it since then. I’ve gotten it repaired multiple times and this time as well, I am going to do the same.”

That day, I witnessed a remarkable example of respect and gratefulness. I think of it as a homage he is paying to something that helped him in his tough times. After all, isn’t that the essence of being human? To remember, to be grateful, and to honor the things and people that have shaped us — no matter how worn or humble they may appear to others.

Upon parting ways, I could not help but imagine a picture where all our cool, shiny bags were enviously looking at their old, battered companion, realising what wealth truly looks like!
